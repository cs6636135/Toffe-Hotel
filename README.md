# Toffe Hotel

## Overview
Toffe Hotel is a hotel booking system analysis project focused on requirement engineering and system modeling.  
The project translates user needs into a structured Software Requirements Specification (SRS), supported by UML diagrams and a UI prototype.

## Objectives
- Analyze user requirements for a hotel booking system  
- Define system requirements (functional and non-functional)  
- Design system workflows and high-level data model  
- Produce Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documentation  
- Create a UI prototype for system visualization  

## Deliverables
- Software Requirements Specification (SRS)  
- UML Diagrams:
  - Use Case Diagram  
  - Class Diagram  
  - Activity Diagram (Swimlane)  
  - ER Diagram  
- Figma Prototype
